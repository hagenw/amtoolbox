@inproceedings{ziegelwanger2013,
	Abstract = {Binaural audio is based on the head-related transfer functions ({HRTFs)}, which provide directional cues for the localization of virtual sound sources. {HRTFs} incorporate the time-of-arrival ({TOA)}, the monaural timing information yielding the interaural time difference, essential for the rendering of multiple virtual sound sources. In this study, we propose a method to robustly estimate spatially continuous {TOA} from an {HRTF} set. The method is based on a directional outlier remover and a geometrical model of the {HRTF} measurement setup. We show results for simulated {HRTFs} of a rigid sphere and {HRTF} of human listeners. The benefits of calculating the {TOA} in the light of the {HRTF} analysis, modifications and synthesis will be discussed.},
