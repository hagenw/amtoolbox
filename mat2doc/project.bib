	issn = {0001-4966 0001-4966},
	abstract = {Two versions of a cascade add, attenuate, and delay circuit were used to generate iterated rippled noise (IRN) stimuli. IRN stimuli produce a repetition pitch whose pitch strength relative to the noise percept can be varied by changing the  type of circuit, the attenuation, or the number of iterations in the circuit. Listeners were asked to use pitch strength to discriminate between various pairs  of IRN stimuli which differed in the type of network used to generate the sounds, the number of iterations, and the attenuation in the network. A description based on an exponential function of the first peak of the autocorrelation function of IRN stimuli is consistent with the results. The discrimination data were well fit by a function based on the difference in the exponential functions of the first peak of the autocorrelation functions. A magnitude estimation experiment indicated that pitch strength was an exponential function of the height of the first peak in the autocorrelation function. These results suggest that the strength of the pitch of IRN stimuli is based on temporal processing as might be  revealed by autocorrelation.},

	Abstract = {Binaural audio is based on the head-related transfer functions ({HRTFs)}, which provide directional cues for the localization of virtual sound sources. {HRTFs} incorporate the time-of-arrival ({TOA)}, the monaural timing information yielding the interaural time difference, essential for the rendering of multiple virtual sound sources. In this study, we propose a method to robustly estimate spatially continuous {TOA} from an {HRTF} set. The method is based on a directional outlier remover and a geometrical model of the {HRTF} measurement setup. We show results for simulated {HRTFs} of a rigid sphere and {HRTF} of human listeners. The benefits of calculating the {TOA} in the light of the {HRTF} analysis, modifications and synthesis will be discussed.},
