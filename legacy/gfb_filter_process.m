%GFB_FILTER_PROCESS  Filter input data
%   Usage: [output, filter] = gfb_filter_process(filter, input)
%
%
%   Input parameters:
%     filter  : A gfb_Filter struct created from gfb_filter_new.  The filter
%               will be returned with an updated filter state as the second
%               return parameter
%     input   : A vector containing the input signal to process
%
%   Output parameters:
%     output  : A vector containing the filter's output signal
%
%   The filter processes the input data.
