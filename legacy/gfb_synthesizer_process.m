% The synthesizer will resynthesize the given input.
%
%  Input parameters:
% synthesizer  A synthesizer structure as created by gfb_synthesizer_new. A
%              copy of the synthesizer object with an updated internal state
%              is returned in the second return parameter
% input        A matrix containing the (possibly processed) complex output of
%              the analyzer corresponding to this synthesizer.  The number of
%              rows in input must match the number of filter bands
% output       The synthesized output signal
