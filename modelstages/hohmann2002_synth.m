function synth = hohmann2002_synth(fb, desired_delay)
%hohmann2002_synth  Create new synthesizer object within HOHMANN2002 filterbank framework
%   Usage: synth = hohmann2002_synth(fb, desired_delay)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     fb            : The filterbank structure as returned by |hohmann2002|.
%     desired_delay : the desired group delay of the total analysis-synthesis
%                     system (in seconds). Minimum delay is 1 sample. 
%                     Greater delays result in better output signal quality. 
%
%   Output parameters:
%     synth : the constructed synthesizer structure
%
%   `hohmann2002_synth` creates a new synthesizer object for the
%   reconstruction of signals analyzed by `fb` within the HOHMANN2002
%   filterbank framework.
